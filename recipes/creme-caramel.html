        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Caramel</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac12; cup sugar</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Creme</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac14; cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 full eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup of evaporated milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the caramel, mix &frac14; water and &frac12; cup sugar till sugar is dissolved</li>
            <li>Put that on the stove on high and do not stir. Not stirring ensures everything boils evenly.</li>
            <li>Wait until it's past bubbling and a light brown golden colour before taking off the stove</li>
            <li>Cover bottoms of the ramekins/containers quickly before the caramel hardens</li>
            <p>Tip! The boiling happens in a matter of minutes, caramel burns quickly, so it's advised you don't leave the stove or room until you're done.</p>
       
            <li>Beat your eggs and egg yolks together till emulsified Additionally you can see foam</li>
            <li>Incorporate &frac14; cup sugar slowly while whisking</li>
            <li>Mix in your water and evaporated milk</li>
            <li>Optional (but for a better aesthetic), strain out the foam bubbles</li>
            <li>Pour into containers and set the containers on a tray with 1-2cm water bath</li>
            <li>Bake for 1h at 325 &#8457;. If you have very small containers, do less time like 55 minutes</li>
            <li>Let it sit in the fridge for at least a few hours, ideally overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Notes: The amount of creme caramel you get will depend on how big your eggs are. It's variable. Additionally, this fill ~4 mini ramekins</p>
